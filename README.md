# GitHub Trayer

A tray application to watch your GitHub notifications.

## Why

On Linux we can add GitHub emoji to our statusbar ([like done there](https://github.com/dakyskye/dotfiles))
which would notify us when we get new GitHub notifications but on Windows it's not that easy. So I decided
to make a tray-only application that would constantly be running and taking care of notifying me of my
GitHub notifications.

## Screenshots

GitHub Trayer's tray icon automatically chooses either dark or light version of GitHub logo depending on
your OS theme settings and it automatically updates the icon after OS theme is changed as well.
